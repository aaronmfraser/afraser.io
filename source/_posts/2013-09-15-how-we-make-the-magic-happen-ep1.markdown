Over the years I have spent much of my time trying to perfect how I "get things done". To start chronicling the tools I use seemed logical.

<!-- more -->

## Tools:
* MacBookPro 15in 16GB RAM: I prefer the latest version available. In this case its the MBP with Retina screen. 
* iPhone 5 32GB
* iPad 32GB w/ [Brydge Keyboard](http://thebrydge.com/)
* Bag: At recommendation from a friend I bought a [Saddleback Leather Classic Briefcase](http://www.saddlebackleather.com/Classic-Briefcase) in my chosen color of chestnut. One of the best purchases I ever made.
